# Numerical Methods Algorithms
Implementation of various algorithms taught in the numerical methods course. Some alogorithms have been implemented in Python 
while some in C++.

## List of algorithms
The algorithms which I have implemented till now are:
* Bisection method
* Chebyshev method
* Regula-Falsi method
* Newton-Raphson method
* Secant method
* Muller's method
* Multipoint method
* Gauss-Elimination

## How to use
* Download the repository.
* Navigate to the local folder where you have saved it through your terminal.
* To run the Python scripts, simply execute `python <filename.py>`.
* To run the C++ scripts, first compile using `g++ <filename.cpp>` and then execute it using `./a.out`.
